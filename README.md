# response-logic
A network inference method based on a simple response logic with minimal presumptions.

This Python 3 package requires clingo version 5.2.2 which is part of [Potassco, the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection](https://potassco.org/).
It can be [installed](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for example with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/):

```
conda install -c potassco clingo=5.2.2
```

Then you can install the response-logic package with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```
pip install git+https://github.com/GrossTor/response-logic#egg=response_logic
```

Once installed you can download the projects folder to run the response logic approach on various example data sets. Look into the `toy_model` project to learn how to use the package. Every project is documented with a dedicated README in its according subfolder.
